     <p>
        Near the end of a most thrilling T20 World Cup final,there were three Indian players under intense pressure. Hardik Pandya, the man the nation had booed relentlessly for a couple of IPL months; lodestar Jasprit Bumrah, who had to again show why he is the greatest T20 bowler ever; and Arshdeep Singh, who the team trusted more than the world. Also dealing with nerves was South Africa, a team that had to get 26 runs from 24 balls with six wickets in hand but whose past meant the game was far from over.

     </p>

     <p>
        From the moment Hardik slipped in a crafty slower one well outside off to dismiss the most nerveless South African on view on the day Heinrich Klassen and gave away just four runs, the pendulum swung dramatically.

        Next over, Jasprit Bumrah not only took
        out Marco 
        Jansen, 
        the last man who could have 
        eased the pressure on David Miller but gave away just two runs.
