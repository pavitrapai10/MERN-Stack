//resuisng code again n again is not good, we can use loops but still
//functions are very very important, building block of dev
//func is basically giving a name to remember it everytime
//syntax is function functionname whwere first word's first letter is small and joining word;s first letters 
//will be capital followed by a parenthesis
function sumOfTwoNumbers() {
    let a =10
    let b=20
    sum=a+b
    console.log(sum)  // untill u call func nothing will be printed
}
sumOfTwoNumbers()
sumOfTwoNumbers()
sumOfTwoNumbers()  //it will print multiple times
